\subsection{Review}

Some filling-in-the-details here, in order to make sure that I'm completely understanding what's happening.

\textbf{Page 29, Prop. 2.8.} The final inequality follows from the averaging principle, but it's not as immediate as meets the eye. We basically use the fact that the elements of $\mathcal{F}$ form a partition of the vertices of $G$, and the fact that every single one of them is a clique. In particular, for any $X,Y\in\mathcal{F}$, the edges from $X$ to $Y$ are not \textit{complete}, and hence $X\cup Y$ is not a clique (also because of the independence of $\alpha$, none of the subsets are cliques either). This means that this is a complete characterization of \textit{all the cliques} in the graph. We then get that the average size of a clique is
$$\frac{1}{|\mathcal{F}|}\sum{X_i\in\mathcal{F}}|X_i| = \frac{n}{|\mathcal{F}|}$$
and it follows from the averaging principle there exists some clique with size greater than or equal to the average clique, and hence
$$\omega(G)\geq\frac{n}{|\mathcal{F}|}.$$

\subsection{Problems}

\paragraph{Question 2.1} Start with the sets $A_i$ and construct new sets $A_{i,j}=A_i\cap A_j$ and $A_i' = A_i\setminus(\cap_{j\neq i} A_j)$. For each $i$, $A_i = A_i'\cup (\cup_{j\neq i} [A_i\cap A_j])$. Then by the union bound we have
$$|A_i|\leq |A_i'|+\sum_{i\neq j}|A_i\cap A_j|$$
and it follows that 
$$\sum_{i=1}^m |A_i| \leq \sum_{i=1}^m |A_i'| + \sum_{i}\sum_{j\neq i}|A_i\cap A_j|$$
Since $|A_i\cap A_j|\leq t$, we have the latter half of the RHS to be $\leq t\binom{m}{2}$. For the former, we notice that $A_i'\cap A_j'=\emptyset$ by definition. Then $\sum_{i=1}^m |A_i'|\leq n$. We have
$$\sum_{i=1}^m |A_i|\leq n + t\binom{m}{2}.$$
